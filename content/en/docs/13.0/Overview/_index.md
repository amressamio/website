FreeBSD&trade; is a modern operating system for desktops, laptops, servers, and embedded systems with support for a 
large number of [platforms](https://www.FreeBSD.org/platforms/).

It is based on U.C. Berkeley's "4.4BSD-Lite" release, with some "4.4BSD-Lite2" enhancements.
It is also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's "Net/2"
to the i386&trade;, known as "386BSD", though very little of the 386BSD code remains.

FreeBSD&trade; is used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers, computer professionals, students and home
users all over the world in their work, education and recreation.
